# Fruit Image Detection using CNN
=========================================================

A machine learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and classify fruit images.

## Project Overview
-------------------

This project aims to develop a fruit image detection and classification system using deep learning techniques. The system will be trained on a dataset of fruit images and will be able to identify different types of fruits from new, unseen images. 

## Technologies Used
--------------------

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow 2.x
* **Dataset:** [kaggel]
* **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

## Project Structure
---------------------

* **data**: Contains the dataset of fruit images used for training and testing.
* **models**: Holds the trained CNN models and their corresponding weights.
* **src**: Source code for the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* **utils**: Utility functions for data loading, augmentation, and visualization.

## Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system
* TensorFlow 2.x installed (pip install tensorflow)
* OpenCV installed (pip install opencv-python)
* NumPy and Pandas installed (pip install numpy pandas)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/fruit-image-detection-cnn.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd fruit-image-detection-cnn`
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the training script: `python src/train.py`
5. Evaluate the model: `python src/evaluate.py`

## Results
